<h1 style="color:blue;">Goals for this Webpage</h1>
<p>This webpage is just a place for me to practice my html and see what I can add and update this with.<br> I plan on adding some links to my projets and maybe some descriptions of what I've done.<br>
    For now, goal for this page is to create some kind of backend to give it functionality besides just being text.
